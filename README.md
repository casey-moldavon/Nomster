#Front-end Design (Casey)

For Front-End there are typically four primary challenges i tend to encounter on a project. The first being the overall design and layout. For this project specifically, i very much lucked out as the team i was working in established very early on a very specific, simplistic and clear design. Even the images of our inital wireframe match the final product almost exactly. The second challenge, being the actual designing and coding was a somewhat more challenging endevor. Translating what we had in mind into actual reality took more time than i initally anticipated along with many small revisions when accounting for adjustments in the screen size/resolution. Once that was done, the third challenge came about, being the artistic and creative touches such as color schemes, images, etc. Thankfully i got somewhat lucky here as, oddly enough, the initial image search (litterally googled "Cute Monster") presented a very clear and instantaneous selection. From this point, i simply changed the colors and elements of the page to match that of the monster's and the page took off from there. This brings me to the fourth challenge which, unfortunately, often persists throughout the remainder of the project. I am speaking of the adjustments and constant manipulation to the original design based on the adding of content. An example of this would be when the map function was completed by Lucas. Not only did the css and html have to be adjusted to accomodate this feature but it also needed to be modified and adjusted along with the divs and containers it was inserted into. The same can also be said for when the restaurant lists were added by Manuel. These also required a great deal of adjusting and editing (visually speaking). Any further changes or modifications had to constantly be monitored in case they affected the overall layout and display of the project. Overall though, i was very lucky and have an amazingly efficient and productive team so i was easily able to make adjustments without too much trouble. I will say though, this was certainly a challenge but one i was very happy to accept. I'm very proud of our end product and hope to work with these guys again.
